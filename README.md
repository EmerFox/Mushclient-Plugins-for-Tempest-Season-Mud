# Mushclient Plugins for Tempest Season
[Mushclient](http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/mushclient.htm) is a free client for playing [Multi-User Dungeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), text-based multiplayer online games.
I will post Mushclient plugins adapted for playing  [Tempest Season](http://www.tempestseason.com) here for other players to use and suggest improvements on. 
Mud Address is game.tempestseason.com, Port 6000.
To get the [Mapper](https://github.com/EmerFox/mushclientplugins/blob/master/Tempest_Season_MAP.xml) to work, type 'config MAP_VIEW_TOP' and 'config ROOM_NAME_TAG' after you have created your character ingame.
